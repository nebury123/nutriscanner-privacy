    <h1>Privacy Policy for NutriScanner</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: January 18, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how NutriScanner ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our primary goal is to provide a helpful tool for analyzing food products. To achieve this, we access certain features of your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> We use the camera solely to scan food product barcodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Gallery:</strong> Users may optionally choose to upload an image of a barcode from their gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> All image processing (extracting the barcode) is done locally and ephemerally on your device. We do not upload your photos to our servers or store them after the barcode is read.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) to help us improve the app's performance and user experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Firebase may collect anonymous information such as device identifiers (Android ID), app usage patterns, session duration, and device model.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used strictly for technical analytics and app stability. It is not used for targeted advertising or shared with third parties for marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Transfers</h2>
    <p>NutriScanner is designed to be privacy-friendly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not require user accounts or registration.</li>
        <li>We do not store your personal identity, name, or contact information.</li>
        <li>Analytical data collected by Firebase is stored securely by Google.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. GDPR and International Rights (EU Users)</h2>
    <p>If you are using the app within the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights under GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The right to access and receive a copy of the anonymous data we have.</li>
        <li>The right to request the deletion of your analytical data.</li>
        <li>The right to object to the processing of your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion Policy</h2>
    <p>Since NutriScanner does not use accounts, we do not have a "Delete Account" button. However, we are committed to your right to be forgotten:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How to request deletion:</strong> If you wish to have your anonymous analytics data deleted from our Firebase records, please contact us at <strong>nebury.studio@gmail.com</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Required Info:</strong> To identify your specific data, you may need to provide your 'App Instance ID', which can be found in the app settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is rated for everyone (3+). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at: <strong>nebury.studio@gmail.com</strong></p>
